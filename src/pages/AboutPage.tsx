        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-unison-text-secondary">
          Most Wanted is songs nobody's submitted lyrics for yet, ranked by reputation-weighted demand. One request from
          a long-time contributor outranks a hundred from throwaway accounts, so the top of the board reflects what
          people actually care about and not who has the most browser tabs open.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-unison-text-secondary">
          The Leaderboard ranks people by submission volume and how much of that work survived voting. Names like
          "BrightVivaceRoll" come from each contributor's public key, which means no accounts and no usernames to fight
          over.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-unison-text-secondary">
          Install Better Lyrics. With a YT Music song open, the player footer has the buttons you need. Click "Request
          lyrics" to push a song onto Most Wanted, or report bad sync on a song that already has lyrics so it gets a
          second look. To submit lyrics yourself, click "Submit lyrics with Unison" at the bottom of the page; if you
          don't have a synced version handy,{" "}

          lets you sync lyrics yourself. Voting on existing submissions is what decides which version Better Lyrics
          shows everyone else by default.

          You don't need to sign in to use any of this. If you do, your row on the Leaderboard gets marked when you're
          ranked, and there's a /me page with your stats. It reuses the chunk of your identity Better Lyrics already
          keeps for you, so there's nothing extra to set up.

        Heads up: without the Better Lyrics extension (Firefox, for example), sign in with your identity file. Export it
        in Better Lyrics options → Identity → Export Key, then pick Sign in → Upload identity file. Linking Discord
        still needs the extension in Chrome or Edge.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-unison-text-secondary">
          Signed-in users can connect a Discord account from the /me page. It earns you roles in our server that mirror
          where you sit on the Leaderboard, and it drops a small Discord mark next to your name across Unison so the
          linked curators are easy to spot. The same page is where you set a nickname, if going by a key-derived name
          like "BrightVivaceRoll" isn't your thing, or you can edit it from Better Lyrics under the Identity tab.

          The server is also where we hang out and talk shop, fixing bad sync and figuring out what to build next. If
